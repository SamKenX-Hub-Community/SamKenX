You can use predefined themes provided by **refine**. In this example, we have created an example application by using the [`RefineThemes`](/docs/api-reference/mui/theming/#predefined-themes) from `@refinedev/mui`. You can easily [customize your theme](/docs/api-reference/mui/theming/#overriding-the-themes) as you wish in your **refine** project.
