You can use predefined themes provided by **refine**. In this example, we have created an example application by using the [`RefineThemes`](/docs/api-reference/mantine/theming/#predefined-themes) from `@refinedev/mantine`. You can easily [customize your theme](/docs/api-reference/mantine/theming/#overriding-the-themes) as you wish in your **refine** project.
